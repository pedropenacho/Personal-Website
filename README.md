# Founders and Coders Application
This website is part of the prerequisites of Founders and Coders course. Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript - no libraries or frameworks
used. Includes a responsive image carousel displaying my personal projects with the respective links for the project and source code. At the end of the page there are links to this GitHub repo, and my FreeCodeCamp, Codewars and LinkedIn profiles.
## Future improvements ##
This webpage was built with a desktop/laptop screen in mind. I run out of time to design the site for mobile devices using media queries,
optimization for mobiles is the next improvement to do on this page.
