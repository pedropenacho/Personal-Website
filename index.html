                <p id="bio">I am a young self-taught developer with strong problem-solving skills and passion to create products that can change peoples life.
                        I was introduced to programming for the first time during university but it wasn't until my first job that I really got serious about coding and develop a strong passion for it.
                        Always enjoyed building and creating things from nothing, that was the main reason that made me decide for a engineering degree, when I first started working with software and eletronics I was realised all I could do and create with such a few resources and was amaed by it, I started to grow more interested in programming which day until it became clear that this was what I wanted to do for life.</p>
